1. **Create a new Node.js project:** Use the npm init command to create a new Node.js project. This will create a package.json file that will contain the dependencies for your project.

2. **Install the necessary dependencies:** Use the npm install command to install the following dependencies:

express
mongodb
body-parser
Connect to the MongoDB database: Use the mongodb library to connect to your MongoDB database. You will need to provide the connection URL and credentials for your database.

3. **Create the API routes:** Use the express library to create the API routes. You can use the get, post, put, and delete methods to handle different types of HTTP requests.

4. **Define the data model:** Use the mongodb library to define the data model for your API. This will define the structure of the documents that will be stored in the MongoDB database.

5. **Implement the API logic:** Implement the logic for each API route to handle the data operations (CRUD)

6. **Test the API:** Use a tool such as Postman to test your API endpoints.
