1. **Create a login form**: Create an HTML form with input fields for a username and password, and a submit button to send the form data to the server.
2. **Handle form submission on the server**: Use Node.js to handle the form submission and retrieve the username and password from the request body.
3. **Authenticate the user**: Use the provided username and password to authenticate the user by checking them against a database or other data store.
4. **Create and sign the JWT**: Use a library or framework of your choice (such as jsonwebtoken) to create and sign a JWT with the user's information as the payload.
5. **Send the JWT to the client**: Send the JWT to the client as a response to the login request.
6. **Handle the JWT on the client**: On the client-side, use JavaScript to handle the received JWT, such as storing it in a browser cookie or local storage for later use.
7. **Protect routes**: Use the JWT to protect routes on the server, only allowing authenticated users access to certain routes or resources.
